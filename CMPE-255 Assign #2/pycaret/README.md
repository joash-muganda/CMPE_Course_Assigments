This repository contains code and data for various data science tasks as part of an assignment. Here's an overview of what was done for each task:

Tasks: Classification
Binary Classification - Level:

Used the PyCaret library to predict binary outcomes on a dataset.
Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and prepared it for modeling.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained multiple models to predict binary targets.
Multiclass Classification - Level:

Expanded the binary classification task to work with multiple classes.
Employed PyCaret for data prep and model training.
Predicted a target variable with several classes.
Evaluated model performance using different metrics.
Regression:

Used PyCaret for regression analysis on a dataset.
Handled data preprocessing tasks such as dealing with missing data and encoding categorical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained and evaluated regression models to predict continuous target values.
Clustering:

Explored clustering techniques using PyCaret.
Grouped data into clusters using clustering algorithms.
Visualized clusters and analyzed their properties.
Anomaly Detection:

Explored anomaly detection using PyCaret.
Focused on identifying unusual data points (anomalies) within the dataset based on various features.
Investigated time series forecasting using PyCaret.
Split time series data into training and testing sets.
Trained forecasting models for univariate and univariate with exogenous variables scenarios.
Corresponding Targets or Objectives:

Classification:

Binary Classification - Level:

Predicted 'GDP_Class' - Binary classification based on GDP classification.
Multiclass Classification - Level:

Predicted 'GDP_Category' - Multiclass classification based on GDP category with multiple classes.
Regression:

Predicted 'GDP (current US$)' - Regression based on the continuous GDP values.
Clustering:

The clustering task was feature-based, and no specific target variable was used.
Anomaly Detection:

The goal was to identify anomalies or outliers in the dataset based on various features.
This description provides a more informal summary of the tasks and objectives.
