This repository holds the code and datasets used in a series of data science tasks. The tasks range from classification, both binary and multiclass, regression, clustering, to anomaly detection.

Tasks Overview
1. Classification
a. Binary Classification - Level
Utilized PyCaret for binary classification on a dataset.
Data cleaning, missing value handling, and preparation were conducted.
The data was divided into training and test sets.
Multiple models were trained to predict binary targets.
Objective: Predicted the 'GDP_Class' which is a binary classification based on GDP levels.

b. Multiclass Classification - Level
Adapted the binary classification to handle multiple classes.
Utilized PyCaret for data preparation and model training.
Predicted a target variable that had several classes.
Evaluated the models using varied metrics.
Objective: Predicted the 'GDP_Category', a multiclass classification based on GDP categories with multiple classes.

2. Regression
Employed PyCaret for regression analysis on a dataset.
Addressed data preprocessing challenges like handling missing data and encoding categorical data.
Partitioned the data into training and test sets.
Trained models to predict continuous target values.
Objective: Predicted 'GDP (current US$)', a regression task based on continuous GDP values.

3. Clustering
Explored clustering techniques with PyCaret.
Data was grouped into clusters employing clustering algorithms.
Visualization of the clusters was performed, followed by an analysis of their characteristics.
Objective: The task was feature-centric, without a particular target variable.

4. Anomaly Detection
Investigated anomaly detection using PyCaret.
The primary focus was to pinpoint anomalous data points within the dataset.
Objective: Identified anomalies or outliers based on various dataset features.
