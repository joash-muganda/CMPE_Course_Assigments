# Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables

## Overview

This repository provides a guide on conducting Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables using the PyCaret library. Below are the steps to follow:

## Steps

### Load Your Dataset

- Begin by uploading a cleaned stock price dataset in CSV format.
- The dataset should include a 'Date' column and the 'Close' prices of the stock.
- In the provided example, TSLA stock data was used.

### Environment Setup

- Set up the forecasting environment using PyCaret's time_series module.
- Specify the target variable as 'Close.'
- Configure parameters, including the session ID, fold strategy, fold value, and forecasting horizon (fh).

### Training and Model Comparison

- Train and compare various forecasting models using 'Close' prices as the target variable.
- PyCaret's compare_models function helps identify the best-performing model based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Predict Future Values

- Once the best model is identified, use it to predict future values.
- Set the 'fh' parameter to the desired forecasting horizon (e.g., 30) to forecast future time points.

### Visualize Predictions

- Visualize the forecasted values generated by the selected model using PyCaret's plotting functions.
- This step provides insights into the model's performance and predicted trends.

By following these steps and customizing the dataset and parameters according to your requirements, you can apply Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables to your own data effortlessly.
